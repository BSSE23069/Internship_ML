                        🏠 Task 6: House Price Prediction
Objective: Predict California house prices using property features (income, age, location) with a Gradient Boosting model and a Streamlit dashboard.
                                📂 Files
House_Price_Prediction.py: Backend script for model training and console evaluation.
App.py: Full-stack Streamlit application featuring EDA and a Predictive UI.
                        🚀 How to Run
1. Terminal Script:
open:
python House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
run each cell 
2. Interactive Web App:
code
Bash
streamlit run App.py
📈 Model & UI Results
Backend Performance
The model utilizes a Gradient Boosting Regressor. The console output confirms the training success and provides evaluation metrics.
R-Squared Score: ~0.81 (High accuracy).
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Tracking average prediction deviation.

Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)
The web application is divided into three professional sections:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Displays a preview of the raw census data and a Correlation Heatmap to show which features (like Median Income) most impact house prices.
![alt text](/Screenshots/image-9.png)
Model Performance Metrics: Real-time display of Accuracy and Error scores in a dashboard format.
![alt text](/Screenshots/image-10.png)
Predictive Tool: An interface where users can input custom data to receive an instant price estimation.
